 template_body vs template_url:
  Use template_body = file("path") if your JSON/CFN is local.
  Use template_url = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/.../voccf.json" if itâ€™s hosted on S3.

 IAM Capabilities:
  CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM is needed because the stack defines IAM roles and policies.
  CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND is often used if macros are in play (not mandatory here but safe to include).

 Parameter Formatting:
  Comma-separated values must be quoted as a single string.
  The CFN stack handles splitting values internally.

 File Format:
  Make sure the CFN template is in JSON or YAML.
  If your file is called voccf.txt, rename it to voccf.json.
