### Non Working Example


The source for this comes from a Stack Overflow post.<br>
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65419033/how-to-create-multiple-vm-nics-in-a-loop-using-terraform-with-static-ipaddress-a

I only needed 2 NICs so I modified the .tfvars file 

I also have added additional comments to add some clarity since this template can be a little confusing if you are new to Terraform like I am.
