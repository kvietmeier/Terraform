### Create multiple VMs with 2 NICs each on different subnets

The source for this comes from a Stack Overflow post.<br>

I only needed 2 NICs so I modified the .tfvars file 

I also have added additional comments to add some clarity since this template can be a little confusing if you are new to Terraform like I am.
