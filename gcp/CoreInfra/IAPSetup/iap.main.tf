# Terraform Configuration File
#
# Description: Assigns IAP user access roles for Google Cloud VMs
#              - Grants IAP tunnel access at the project level for a list of users
#              - Grants Compute Viewer role at the project level for a list of users
#              - Grants OS Login External User role at the instance level for each user-instance pair
#
# Author:      Karl Vietmeier
# License:     Apache 2.0
#
# Usage:
#  - Configure project_id, user_emails, and instances variables
#  - Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply`
#
# Notes:
#  - `roles/iap.tunnelResourceAccessor` must be assigned at the project level
#  - `roles/compute.osLoginExternalUser` must be assigned per instance
#  - Ensure instance names and zones are accurate to avoid 404 errors
#
#
# Connect to VM with:
# gcloud compute ssh USERNAME@INSTANCE_NAME --zone=ZONE --ssh-key-file=/path/to/private_key.pem --tunnel-through-iap
#
# gcloud compute ssh labuser1@devops01 --zone=us-west2-a --ssh-key-file= --tunnel-through-iap

Refactor - to use a list - 
This revised code block creates a unique key for each combination of user and role 
(e.g., user1@example.com:roles/iap.tunnelResourceAccessor), which allows for_each to 
correctly create a separate google_project_iam_member resource for every single assignment.

 # Define a list of roles to assign
locals {
  roles_to_assign = [
    "roles/iap.tunnelResourceAccessor",
    "roles/compute.viewer"
  ]
}

# Assign roles to all users using a single resource block
resource "google_project_iam_member" "user_roles" {
  for_each = toset([
    for user in var.user_emails :
    for role in local.roles_to_assign : "${user}:${role}"
  ])

  project = var.project_id
  role    = split(":", each.key)[1]
  member  = "user:${split(":", each.key)[0]}"
