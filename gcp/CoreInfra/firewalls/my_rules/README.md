### Create Custom GCP Firewall Rules

This set of rules will open a specific set of ports for common services and additional ports for applications and filter incoming traffic on public interfaces to specific IPs and/or IP ranges

It is written to allow you easily and quickly update the FW rules as your local IP changes (hotel, coffee shop, etc.) or you need to allow additional people into your VPC.
