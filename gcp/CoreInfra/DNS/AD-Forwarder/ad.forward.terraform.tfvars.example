#  Purpose:      Create DNS forwarding zone for Active Directory domain
#  Description:  This configuration sets up a Cloud DNS forwarding zone in GCP to
#                route DNS queries for an Active Directory domain to a specified
#                on-prem or cloud DNS resolver.
#
#  Notes:
#    - The `fw_target` is the IP of the DNS server to which queries should be forwarded.
#    - The zone must be private and attached to one or more VPC networks.
